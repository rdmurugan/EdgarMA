Abstract

Publicly traded companies in the U.S. submit annual 10-K filings to the EDGAR
SEC system, providing comprehensive details about financial conditions, business strate-
gies, and corporate actions such as Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A). Traditional meth-
ods for analyzing 10-K filings are manual and time-consuming, limiting scalability in
corporate due diligence and financial research. This paper introduces a novel auto-
mated approach that leverages Legal-BERT for entity extraction, semantic filtering
using GloVe embeddings, and contextual filtering with sentence embeddings to iden-
tify key entities and provisions related to M&A activities. Our hybrid method achieves
a significant improvement in F1-score (up to 87.8%) compared to using Legal-BERT
alone (78.2%) by effectively reducing false positives while maintaining high recall.
This approach offers a scalable solution for financial analysis, compliance monitoring,
risk assessment, and competitive analysis.
